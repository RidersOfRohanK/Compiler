1) A Hashmap would be better in this situation because we don't care as much about keeping
all the entries sorted, we care more about making sure that there are faster lookups. A
TreeMap would be better if we wanted things in sorted order or if we needed more memory

2) I used an ArrayList because we care more about storing things than we do manipulating
them. There is no removeDecl which means we are not taking things out of the list. For the
most part all we are doing is adding things or iterating over them. For these tasks a
LinkedList is better.
